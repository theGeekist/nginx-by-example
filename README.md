  Real-world patterns. Fully tested. Mapped one-to-one with the <a href="https://geekist.co/nginx-by-example">NGINX by Example</a> book.<br/>
  This repo contains the live configurations and automated test suite that backs every chapter.
</p>

## Quick Start

> **Requirements**
> [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed globally
> Docker + Docker Compose
>   

### 1. Start the Docker environment

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
````

This starts:

* A custom NGINX container with SSL and test configs
* WordPress and MySQL (for `3.3_wp_fastcgi_cache`)

### 2. Run the tests

```bash
bun test
```

All tests are written in Bunâ€™s native test runner and validate full NGINX behaviour via actual HTTP requests.

## Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ docker/                 # NGINX container structure
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ conf.d/             # Unused (default vhost configs)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sites-enabled/      # Active site configs (symlinked per test)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ srv/                # Shared static assets (HTML, images, etc.)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ocsp/ ssl/ cache/   # TLS and OCSP material
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ nginx.conf          # Custom NGINX entrypoint
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml      # Defines nginx, WordPress & MySQL
â”œâ”€â”€ sections/               # Each section in the book is mapped here
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 1.1_ocsp_stapling/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 2.5_smart_api_gateways/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 3.4_invisible_cdn/  # ...and so on
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/                  # Test helper utilities (reload nginx, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ bun.lockb / package.json / tsconfig.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md               # This file
```

## Testing Philosophy

Each section follows the same pattern:

* `default.conf`: Minimal NGINX config for the use case
* `index.test.ts`: Test cases that simulate HTTP traffic and assert real behaviour
* Assets (e.g. `/images/logo.png`, `compressed.html`) are shared via `/srv`

The goal is to ensure every config in the book runs and behaves exactly as described, reproducibly and without handwaving.

## Need to Test a Single Section?

```bash
bun test sections/2.4_blue_green_deployments/index.test.ts
```

## Notes

* Brotli support is baked in using [`georgjung/nginx-brotli`](https://hub.docker.com/r/georgjung/nginx-brotli)
* OCSP stapling and TLS tests use local self-signed certs under `/docker/ssl/`
* WordPress tests use FastCGI cache and run against a real PHP-FPM container


## Book Reference

This test harness is the official companion to
**NGINX by Example Vol 1**

Each section here maps to a chapter in the book tested and reproducible.
